** "Bandeja Paisa!" **
In this p5 created interactive display, the Colombian dish Bandeja Paisa is on the screen and once clicked, displays what is in the dish.

** Summary **
Here, write a paragraph or two describing what you built for your final project and what was challenging.
Include a discussion how it will be interactive or responsive to the environment.

I made a little interactive piece where a dish of food is displayed, can be clicked and redirects you to what is in the dish
in the form of a list. There is a video playing behind the text boxes and the audio can be controlled with keystrokes.
I found the video addition pretty challenging but very worth it. It was much like adding sound in general.

** Component Parts **
From what pieces did you build your project?
Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use, and a diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.

PNGs of food > Flag border made of rects > Set video in background of clicked redirection >
Place white box, yellow boxes, text with ingredients > Add volume control

** Challenges **
A brief discussion of what was hard, challenging, or unexpected about your project.

Trying to click each image was incredibly difficult so I ended up dropping it. I tried to add the hover for the boxes
as well and didn't manage to have the time/ability to do so.
